# Resolution
The datasets and jupyter notebooks that are used for the "Resolution" project.
Briefly: we have the electric field intensity values measured with a probe and calculated numerically. Since the probe is wider the device under investigation, the measured field intensities are very different from the true values. The goal is predicting the true values from the measured values using machine learning.
